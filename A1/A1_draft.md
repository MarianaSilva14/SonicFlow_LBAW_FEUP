# A1: Online Shop

This project intends to specify, develop and promote an online shopping system. This shop specializes in electronic components and products. Its target users range from experts to people with little technological knowledge that still want to make an informed decision.


We think that, nowadays, with the increase in usage of technology there is a gap for a user friendly platform that can serve any type of person without any technological background requirements.


The platform will have an intuitive design allowing users to freely explore the content. The search will be customizable and the platform will include product categories to facilitate navigation. The search engines will be fast and assertive. Users will be able to buy, rate and comment on products. Similar products can be compared and products listing can be ordered as wished. A product configurator is also available to help users choose and swap components for a system according to their needs and visualize the final system cost.


Users are separated into groups with different permissions. There must be administration usage profiles, with all the privileges of access and modification. There also must be registered users to buy products that can see the content of the platform and moderators with privileges of access to enter new products and check commentaries to filter out unproper behaviour.
