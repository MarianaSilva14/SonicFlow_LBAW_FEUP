Figure 1: Interface's guidelines.

In this figure some characteristics common to all the pages are highlighted:
* We opted for a simple design to have a flowing web page layout that suits various screen sizes, from desktops to smartphones.
* It was decided to stay within web conventions and use a color palette that fits our logo.
* The common links to the various pages maintain their position to make the user experience consistent.
* Different sections have clearly distinct styles in order to highlight distinct hierarchies of information, and assist with the visual flow.


## 2. Sitemap
