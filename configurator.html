        A CPU(Central Processing Unit) is the required processor for a computer
        to operate. A CPU consists in one or more independant processing cores
        but they can still work together so the more cores your CPU has the more
        the more calculations you can make per time unit. Each core can have one
        or two threads(separate logical processing units) so as with cores the
        same rule aplies. Intel developed Hyperthreading technology and AMD "...".
        If your CPU has one of these technology them the number of threads in your
        CPU is 2 per core otherwise it's 1. It's worth noting that some CPU's
        include a graphics processor aswell.
        Suggestions:

            High Performance (16+ Threads)
            <p>
              High perfomance CPU's are ideal for distributed workload that can
              make use of all the available threads. These workload are presented
              by video and image rendering
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Medium Performance (8-12 Threads)
            <p>
              Ideal for a distributed workload, these CPU's are good for gaming
              and multitasking as they have high clock speeds which increase the
              speed of light workload and still have enough processing capacity
              to do some heavy workloads.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Low Performance (8- Threads)
            <p>
              These CPU's are often used for light workloads that won't require
              much processing power. Their selling points are lower cost and power
              comsumption. Ideal for medium multitasking and lower-end gaming.

        The Graphics Card is a board which includes all the necessary components
        to do graphic processing, these processors are required mainly for gaming
        but in general they can perform very distributed tasks for their high amount
        of cores and they do this tasks very fast as they only process specialized
        workloads. If you don't need to do any specialized workloads you might want
        to consider a CPU with an integrated graphics processor as it can reduce
        your system's overall cost. Something to note here is the VRAM available.
        Cards with the same processor have different amounts of memory available
        as each task requires specific memory space, you should take your use in
        account when choosing between memory amount.
