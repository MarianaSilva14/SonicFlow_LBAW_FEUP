## A1. Annex: Supplementary requirements
 
This annex contains business rules, technical requirements and other restrictions on the project
 
### A1.1. Business rules

A business rule defines or constrains one aspect of the business, with the intention of asserting business structure or influencing business behaviour.

Table 7: Business Rules
 
### A1.2. Technical requirements

Technical requirements are concerned with the technical aspects that the system must meet, such as performance-related issues, reliability issues and availability issues.

|Identifier	|Name	|Description|

TR01|Availability|	The system must be available 99 percent of the time in each 24-hour period.|
TR02|Accessibility|	The system must ensure that everyone can access the pages, regardless of whether they have any handicap or not, or the Web browser they use.|
TR03|Usability|	The system should be simple and easy to use.|
TR04|Performance|	The system should have response times shorter than 2s to ensure the user's attention.|
TR05|Web application|	The system should be implemented as a Web application with dynamic pages (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS3 and PHP).|
TR06|Portability|	The server-side system should work across multiple platforms (Linux, Mac OS, etc.).|
TR07|Database|	The PostgreSQL 9.4 database management system must be used.|
TR08|Security|	The system shall protect information from unauthorised access through the use of an authentication and privilege verification system.|
TR09|Robustness|	The system must be prepared to handle and continue operating when runtime errors occur.|
TR10|Scalability|	The system must be prepared to deal with the growth in the number of users and corresponding operations.|
TR11|Ethics|	The system must respect the ethical principles in software development (for example, the password must be stored encrypted to ensure that only the owner knows it).|

Table 8: Technical Requirements.

### A1.3. Restrictions
