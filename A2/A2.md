## A1. Annex: Supplementary requirements

This annex contains business rules, technical requirements and other restrictions on the project

### A1.1. Business rules

|BR05|Comment History|When a comment is deleted it should be replaced with a generic [DELETED] comment. This prevents confusion in comments' history.|

Table 7: Business Rules

### A1.2. Technical requirements

Technical requirements are concerned with the technical aspects that the system must meet, such as performance-related issues, reliability issues and availability issues.
