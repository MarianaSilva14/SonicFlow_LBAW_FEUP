# A1: Online Shop

#### Goals, Business Context and Environment

This project intends to specify, develop and promote an online shopping system. This shop specializes in electronic components and products. Its target users range from experts to people with little technological knowledge that still want to make an informed decision.

#### Motivation

We think that, nowadays, with the increase in usage of technology there is a gap for a user friendly platform that can serve any type of person without any technological background requirements.

#### Main Features

The platform will have a simple intuitive design allowing users to freely explore the content and at the same time customize their search parameters as to allow a comprehensive shopping experience regardless of the access device. To achieve this, the search engines will be fast and assertive, allowing users to easily search items and helpfull tools will be implemented to better model the user's purpose.

#### User Profiles

Users are separated into groups with different permissions. There must be administration usage profiles, with all the privileges of access and modification. There also must be registered users to buy products that can see the content of the platform and moderators with privileges of access to enter new products and check commentaries to filter out unproper behaviour.
