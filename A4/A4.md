## 2. Additional Business Rules

Besides the conceptual data model shown before, we have included some extra rules to facilitate the understanding of our data model.

|Identifier	|Name	|Description|
|:---------:|-----|-----------|
|BR01|Consistency|A customer can only comment on a product he has previously bought.|
|BR02|Loyalty |For each purchase the user gets 1 Loyalty Point.|
|BR03|Comment History|When a comment is deleted it should be replaced with a generic [DELETED] comment.|

<!-- > Business rules can be included in the UML diagram as UML notes or in a table in this section. -->
